If you are in either an organization or site, the breadcrumb will expose a settings icon that allows you to set high performance settings for that area. This is currently limited to user permissions and AEM integrations.\n          Selecting one or more items will expand the Action Bar. The action bar will present many common actions for your content. If you feel an action is missing, there is likely an app (bulk ops) that can accept the URLs shared from the Action Bar.\n          Search is powerful, precise, and basic. Basic + precise can be both a positive and negative. Searching for \"aem\" will result in only getting lower case results. Searching for \"AEM\" will yield different results. There are common search recipes listed below.\n        \n      \n      \n        Browse basics\n        Below you will find details about basic browsing.

This may not be desirable and you may want to scope your search to a series of sub-folders.\n          Find & replace does not currently version on replace. Be absolutely sure you are making the desired replacement. If something goes wrong, you will need to restore from aem.page, aem.live or an older version.

Example: Clicking into a table will expose the edit table button in the edit menu.\n          Palettes stay open. Menus do not. Similar to Adobe Creative Cloud, larger palettes that may need to be used while working in the document will stay open. Library plugins can opt to close the library palette if the interaction should be a one-time event (like selecting a tag). Menus like the expanded text menu will close after click.\n          There can be subtle differences from other editors. Much like comparing Google Docs to Microsoft Word, Document Authoring does have subtle differences from existing authoring tools.

Here are a few tips to help get you started.\n        \n          \n            style\n            center, container\n          \n          \n            spacing-top\n            800\n          \n          \n            spacing-bottom\n            400\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          All sheet tabs are public by default. Because DA sheets are targeted towards public web content and not line of business applications, all sheets are public by default. If you would like a sheet to be private, you can prefix the sheet with \"private-\".\n          DA sheets are not designed to replace all Excel use cases. At the time of this writing, DA sheets do not have feature parity with Excel and Google Sheets. If you require conditional formatting, formulas, or you have 10,000+ rows, we recommend you keep this content in SharePoint / Google Drive and use AEM's content overlay feature.\n          Previewing a sheet saves the sheet. - Unlike DA docs, you need to manually preview and save your sheet.\n        \n      \n      \n        Basics\n        Below you will find details about basic editing. If you have made spreadsheets in other applications like Excel or Google Sheets, Document Authoring (DA) should feel familiar and intuitive.\n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            style\n            center, container\n          \n          \n            spacing\n            1000\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Edit sheet details\n        You can use the edit sheet button to edit the sheet name or delete the sheet completely.\n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            style\n            center, container\n          \n          \n            spacing\n            1000\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Editing rows, columns, cells, and more\n        Right clicking into a cell can help you work with your content. You can add rows and columns, delete them, or even export your sheet as a CSV.\n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            style\n            center, container\n          \n          \n            spacing\n            1000",

This is great for highly curated and re-used content.\n        Drag and drop\n        For those that want a more friction-free approach to handling media, you can drag any supported media onto a doc. This is, by far, the easiest method to get imagery into your docs. The file will be imported into the same folder as the document.\n        Media folder\n        DA provides basic media handling. If you do not have a license for AEM Assets, but wish to organize your media into a central location, we recommend using the media folder. Simply create a top-level folder called \"media\" and upload your content into it. You can open a media file, copy it to the clipboard, and paste it into your document.\n        \n          \n            background\n            #f1f1f1\n          \n          \n            spacing\n            1000\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Content migrations\n        Because DA simply references media, it is possible to do bulk content migrations. This could be anything from changing the source image in place to using search & replace to change a file name. Please consider the following when making these types of changes:\n        \n          All changes in bulk still require a re-preview of the consuming docs so Edge Delivery Services can re-process the changed media.\n          Please note any cache constraints if changing content in AEM Assets. Ensure that you can see the changes in your publish environment before asking Edge Delivery Services to re-preview your content.\n        \n        \n          \n            background\n            #FFF\n          \n          \n            spacing\n            1000",

While on-demand services like Google Translate or even built-in browser translations can be convenient, they can have non-ideal SEO impacts.\n        One of the hallmark features of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is the ability to automate the process of translating, localizing, and rolling out content. In many respects, DA is no different. It provides many similar features, but with a focus on document-based authoring.\n        Managing localized content at scale can be a challenge due to the amount of content that is created. DA gives you, the site owner, the freedom to be as high-touch or hands-off as needed for your project. For example: you are free to organize your site by language or by locale. You are free to auto-publish after rollout or require human authors to curate newly created content.\n      \n      \n        Strategy\n        As we alluded to above, it's important to pick a localization strategy that fits your needs. Adobe's best practices can be read on aem.live. For our setup, we will follow the hybrid approach outlined in the best practices doc. A hybrid approach allows you to be mostly language-based, but provide affordances for locale-based content as necessary. This might be used for events in a region or used for locales where a dialect differs significantly from the source language and you have native speaking authors that can augment the translated content for the locale.\n        Language Only\n        \n          /en\n          /fr\n          /de\n          /cn\n        \n        Locale Only\n        \n          /en-us\n          /en-ca\n          /en-in\n          /fr-fr\n          /fr-ca\n          /de-de\n          /zh-cn\n        \n        Hybrid\n        \n          /en\n          /en/us\n          /fr\n          /fr/ca\n          /de\n          /de/ch\n          /zh\n          /zh/\n        \n        High-level considerations\n        While a language-based approach can provide less overhead, you may run into complexities with commerce, currencies, and VAT.\n        A locale-based approach may provide simplicity in commerce, but it will create undesired duplication of content that is unfriendly for SEO.\n        A hybrid model where the site is predominantly language-based keeps content duplication low. You will still have similar language-based commerce considerations, but this would be considered the preferred option over locale-based.\n        Translation configuration\n        Because every site is different, DA provides a few configuration options to help you manage your content.\n        \n          \n            translate.behavior - How to handle old content when new docs come back from translation.\n            \n              overwrite - Overwrite the old content. Useful for no-touch translation.\n              merge - Merge the old content with the new content. Useful if there is content you want to retain. This option requires human intervention after translation.\n            \n          \n          \n            translate.staging - Stage content in a separate area from your source content before sending to translation service.\n            \n              on - This will copy your source content into a separate folder. This is typically done to make changes to your source docs before sending to translation but not affecting your live content.\n              off - Send source documents directly to the translation service.\n            \n          \n          \n            rollout.behavior - How to handle old content when new docs get rolled out to the locale. This is only used for hybrid and locale-based localization strategies.\n            \n              overwrite - Overwrite the old content. Useful for no-touch translation.\n              merge - Merge the old content with the new content. Useful if there is content you want to retain. This option requires human intervention after translation.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    key\n                    value\n                  \n                  \n                    translate.behavior\n                    overwrite\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            style\n            container",

It also allows you to use the DA App SDK to build rich applications that leverages any content stored on your AEM as a Cloud Service instance.\n        Step 1 - AEM as a Cloud Service\n        An AEM environment config will need to be set. Details in the screenshot below. Expect a full restart (~10-20 minutes) when this is saved.\n        Environment Configuration: ADOBE_PROVIDED_CLIENT_ID | darkalley\n        \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        Step 2 - Dark Alley\n        \n          Visit: https://da.live/config#/name-of-org/name-of-site/\n          Add key | value if it doesn't exist already.\n          Add aem.repositoryId | sub.youraemcloud.com\n          Paper plane > Save\n        \n        Step 3 - Use it\n        \n          Open any page and notice you have a new image icon in your toolbar. This will open a modal to your AEM Assets.\n          Select the asset you want and it will import into your document.\n          The asset must be published for DA & Edge Delivery Services to see it.\n        \n        Use cases\n        In addition to having all the existing benefits of AEM Assets (governance, etc.), there are a couple use cases that can be unlocked related to DA:\n        \n          Swapping an existing asset with an updated version.\n          Bulk replacing an image.\n        \n        It's important to know that even if you change a single asset, if that asset is used on 1000 pages, you will need to re-preview and re-publish those 1000 pages for Edge Delivery Services to ingest the new image and update the references on aem.page and aem.live.\n        Use case 1: Swap an existing asset\n        User story: As an author, I would like to update an existing asset with more vibrant colors without having to change every page the asset is currently used on.\n        \n          On da.live, use the side navigation panel to navigate to your assets using the \"files\" icon.\n          In Adobe Experience Manager Assets, navigate to the folder that contains the asset you want to replace.\n          Replace the asset and re-publish it.\n          Navigate to a page in DA that uses the asset in question.\n          Due to caching constraints, it may take up to a few minutes for the asset to update.\n          Once you can see your changes reflected, Edge Delivery is ready to ingest it. Copy the asset publish URL.\n          Paste the asset publish URL into DA's search. This will list every page on DA that is using the asset.\n          Use the the share button (action bar > share icon) to copy the AEM URLs.\n          Paste the URLs into DA's bulk preview & publish tool (da.live/apps/bulk). Run a preview & publish on these URLs.\n        \n        Note: If you have staged content updates in DA that are not currently live, the bulk preview and publish tools will push these live. You will want to take the necessary steps to ensure you are not pre-maturely publishing page updates as a result of this change.",
